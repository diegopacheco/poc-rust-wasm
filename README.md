# POC WebAssembly with Rust
Just a few examples of using WASM in browser and node.

The concepts and examples came from the [Using WebAssembly with Rust](https://egghead.io/courses/using-webassembly-with-rust). I just took the liberty of changing some little things like add the banckmark in the node example :)
